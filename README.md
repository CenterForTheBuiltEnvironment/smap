sMAP 'unitoftime' branch
========================

This branch is the opposite of production ready. Nevertheless it passes unit tests that don't require operators. Any non-trivial operators will fail as that code has not been written yet (I've been prioritising writing unit tests that pass on the main branch first)

In order for the archiver to work, you need to be running the 'adaptive' branch of readingdb. Which is also not production ready. (We like to have fun here).
